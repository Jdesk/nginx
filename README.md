# nginx
My NGINX Configuration with HHVM and Redis plus a few extras
Structure is as Follows:

/etc/nginx/
acl.conf
1 (error log)		php.conf       redis-hhvm.conf	wpcommon.conf	wpsubdir.conf
acl.conf	php-hhvm.conf        w3tc.conf	    wpfc.conf
locations.conf	redis.conf     w3tc-hhvm.conf	wpfc-hhvm.conf

TO quote my mentors (that don't konw they are) RTcamp - I am changing a few things (grammar wise - but you will get the gist "no pun intended")

- "There is an order for everything - Everything has a place"
